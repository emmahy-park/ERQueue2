# Emergency Room Queue Management

ERQueue is a Java desktop application that has a graphical user interface that triages the patients in the Emergency Room.
In Metro Vancouver, we often face unexpectedly long waits in the Emergency Room.
To minimize the wait time and the workforce of prioritizing patients, this application prioritizes and outputs the estimated wait time and patient queue.

It lets the user (triage nurse) to enter information about the patient (Name, Age, Level of Severity, Time of Arrival).
The triage nurse will enter and update the information.
The patients and guardians waiting in the Emergency Room can see the outputs on the screen.
